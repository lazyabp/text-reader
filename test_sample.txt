This is a test text file for the Text-to-Speech Reader Application.

The purpose of this file is to test that the application can properly read and speak text files aloud using Piper TTS.

It includes multiple sentences to test the text splitting functionality:
This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence! And this is the third one?

The application should be able to handle different punctuation marks and read the text naturally.

Additionally, it should properly track the reading position so that when you restart the application and load the same file, it remembers where you left off.

This functionality is important for users who are reading long documents and need to pick up where they left off.
